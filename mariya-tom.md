I’m Mariya, an Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate. I grew up in India. In the past, I worked in the software development industry. Over the last couple of years, I have been away from the industry due to migrating to New Zealand and having a baby. Now that my baby has turned 10 months old, I am eager to get back into the software development industry and enhance my technical knowledge in React.
